    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p>
        25 years experience in metallurgical field. Experience with specifications (Mil, SAE, ASTM, NAS, AWS, API,
        DoDiSS, NavSea, Din and ISO) including API, NACE, Bell, Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, Cessna, Northrup-Grummen, and
        other customer specifications.</p>

        Have experience in various testing areas including tensile, compression and charpy testing. Can machine test
        bars and fixtures.</p>

        Many types of preparing and testing of metallographic samples including, grain size, micro and macro, grain
        flow, fastener testing, decarburization and carburization, ferrite point count, heat treat condition, IGA and
        pitting, Bell lot acceptance, Vickers and Knoop microhardness, and many others.</p>

        Proficient with non-destructive testing such as hardness, conductivity, visual testing (CWI and ASNT level II
        Visual and liquid Penetrant ASNT level II).</p>

        I have MS Office, HTML, LAN networking and many other IT computer skills. Very mechanical minded. Some
        electronics background also. Can write test reports and make test plans for fasteners, lot acceptances, and
        first articles. Able to read test drawings.</p>
